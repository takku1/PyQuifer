Blue Brain Project (BBP): The literal "Finite Element" model of neuroscience; simulates neocortical columns at the level of individual ion channels and 3D cell geometry.

Spaun (Semantic Pointer Architecture Unified Network): The functional gold standard; a 2.5 million neuron model that can perform eight distinct cognitive tasks (math, memory, vision, motor control).

Human Brain Project (HBP) / EBRAINS: The massive European "mesh" that integrates anatomical, molecular, and functional data into a unified simulation environment.

Allen Institute Mouse V1 Model: A biophysically detailed "stress test" of the primary visual cortex using over 200,000 neurons to match real-time in vivo electrical signals.

The OpenWorm Project: The engineering equivalent of modeling every part of a simple bridge; a bottom-up simulation of the C. elegans roundworm’s 302 neurons and physical body.

Nengo Test Suite: The benchmark for neuromorphic hardware, testing how well dynamical models (like oscillators) solve cognitive tasks across different physical "backends."

Leela Chess Zero (Lc0): The "Neural Intuition" benchmark; used to test how deep reinforcement learning compares to human-like strategic pattern recognition.

Syzygy Tablebases: The "perfect lookup" baseline; used to verify if a simulation’s "intuition" matches the absolute mathematical truth of an endgame.

Rat Neocortical Column: Henry Markram’s original 10,000-neuron "crunch" that proved you could replicate biologically consistent nerve impulses through pure simulation.

Topological Neuronal Synthesis: A new "geometric crunch" that uses algebraic topology to synthesize millions of unique, physically accurate neuronal shapes from a small sample.
