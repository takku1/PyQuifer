# PyQuifer

**A PyTorch library for simulating consciousness through generative world models, tensor physics, and cognitive science principles.**

PyQuifer is an experimental framework designed to explore the concept of a "Mind's Eye" using computational and theoretical neuroscience principles. It provides a set of tools to build generative models that "actualize" coherent representations from structured noise, guided by potential fields.

This library is a research tool for investigating how concepts like stochastic resonance, harmonic series, and predictive processing can be modeled and simulated in a modern deep learning framework.

## Core Concepts

- **The Canvas (Noise):** The foundation is a 3D or 4D noise field (Simplex/Perlin), representing the "latent turbulence" of thought or the raw entropy of the unconscious mind.

- **The Intent (Potential):** Attractor points and potential fields guide the noise, acting as the "will" or "focus" that shapes chaos into a coherent structure.

- **Actualization (Diffusion):** A process inspired by latent diffusion and predictive processing "denoises" the harmonic chaos, allowing a stable, self-referential representation to emerge. This is the moment the "Mind's Eye" sees clearly.

## Philosophy

> "Where Tensor Physics meets Cognitive Science."

PyQuifer is built on the idea that a generative world model can be constructed by simulating the interplay between chaotic, high-dimensional noise and the focusing influence of a "Self" or "Archetype." The process of moving from raw harmonics to a stable internal representation is a simulation of a system achieving self-actualization.
